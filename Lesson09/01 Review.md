Legend:
- A: To be solved by the author
- U: Updated based on further analysis

Further improvements (especially for bigger tables):
- Sort issues based on priority
- Categorise issues (e.g., syntax, functionality, non-functional requirement, missing, etc.)
- Divide the table into several tables (priority-based, category-based, localtion-based, etc.)

**Potential improvement to the SRS**

1. System definition
   
The application is called “Customer Information System” (henceforth CIS).

2. System structure

CIS will consist of:
- a data entry window
- a data display window<br><br>The data display window will obtain data from the data entry window. The data display window will include a printing option to print the information to a printer, or to the following file formats:
  - pdf file
  - json
  - csv

3. User interface

The data entry window will require the user to input the customer information according to the following template (“Template 1”):
- First name. Max. 40 characters. Only Danish alphabetic characters and dash allowed
- Surname. Max. 60 characters. Only Danish alphabetic characters and dash allowed
- Address. Max. 120 characters. Only Danish alphabetic characters, numbers, dot (“.”), comma (“,”), and dash (“-”) allowed
- City. From the list of cities in annex I
- Postal code. Danish format: 3 or 4 numeric digits
- Phone number. Danish phone number format: 8 numeric digits
- Date of birth. Danish date format: “dd/MM/yyyy”
- Preferred display colour **[TBD]**.

All the fields are mandatory except “Phone number”.

The default display colour will be “White”.

There will be an “Ok” button and a “Cancel” button in the data entry window’s bottom right position.
- When clicking the “Cancel” button, the data entry window (and, thus, CIS) will be closed.
- When clicking the “Ok” button, the data display window will appear and show the customer information formatted according to Template 1. Besides, a new row will be displayed below to show the customer’s age status based on the customer’s date of birth and according to the following formula:
  - Customer’s age < 18 years → display “Under-aged”
  - Otherwise → display “Adult”
